A research topic is the subject of a research project or study â€“ for example, a dissertation or thesis. A research topic typically takes the form of a problem to be solved, or a question to be answered. A good research topic should be specific enough to allow for focused research and analysis. Generate me five detailed research topics I can do my Capstone project on. I want my project to solve a problem in the {self.domain} domain. For each topics include a description of the problem it solves. Format your response as markdown'
