# Micro DeFi

### This is the updated version of the DACADE course starter example, using the latest version of Azle cdk with updated syntax for typescript canister development.

This example project will help you to deploy your first canister (application) to the Internet Computer (IC) decentralized cloud. It is a simple getter/setter canister. You can always refer to [The Azle Book](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/) for more in-depth documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Follow these instructions from the Azle Book to [install all the required tools and set up your environment](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/installation.html). If you have already installed the required tools, you can skip this step.


After you have installed the required tools, you can move on to the next step.

## Clone the repository

```bash

Clone this repository and navigate to the `message_board` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mzansiweb3-icp-hub/message_board.git
cd message_board
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the local replica

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

Deploy the canister locally:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
